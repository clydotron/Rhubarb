    "description": "Elk kelp, has a long single stipe, large hollow bulb, and antler-like branches with broad blades. This alga is second in size only to the giant kelp macrocystis, and can be found in depths up to 50 m (150 ft). The stipe is rather small in relation to the large branches and blades, and can break in strong storm surge. When the stipe is broken, the remaining portion of the kelp will be found drifting in ocean currents, and eventually washed up on beaches.",
